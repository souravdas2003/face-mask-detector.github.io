## Introduction
-A real-time detector to check weather a person in the frame is wearing a mask or
not.</br>
-We first detect the face of the person from the image or video file and live camera.</br>
-We then process the face and predict the results using a face mask detector.</br> 
-The face mask detector model used is based on TensorFlow.</br>

## Technologies Used
- Programming Langugage: Python,opencv-python(cv2): for facial recognition and image processing,numpy: For Mathematical Operations on array data structures, keras: for deep learning(CNN) and machine learning to detect faces.
- IDE, Code Editor and other Tools
- VS Code
- git
- GitHub
## Installation
